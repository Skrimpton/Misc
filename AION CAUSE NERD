**__MACRO COMMANDS__**
(stolen from powerbook and others - and tested):

Default Macro Window hotkey: 
```U```
**/Delay** X 

*Delay is measured in seconds*

*Example:* 
```/Delay 3
Macro will wait 3 seconds before performing the next command```
**/Skill**

*You can drag the skill from Skills-list into the Enter Macro Command-field or type the name of the skill*

*Example:*
```/Skill Blessing of Rock I
/Delay 1
/Blessing of Health 1

Result: target blessed with both cleric buffs and only one quickbar slot used```
**/Use**

*Type [The Item Name] accurately - Or just drag-n-drop item into edit-field*

*Example 1:*
```/Use Big Lazuli Ore
/Delay 3
/Use Big Lazuli ore
/Delay 3
/Use Big Lazuli ore

Result: Opens Lazuli Ore bundles. Avoids carpal tunnel syndrome```

*Example 2:*
```/Use Healing Root
/Use Greater Life Serum
/Use Greater Running Scroll

Result: Uses a Healing Root to cure altered state, then immediately uses Greater Life Serum and Greater Running Scroll.```
**/Quickbar**

*You can also  drag-n-drop  from quickbar into edit-field*

*Example:*
```/Quickbar 1 0 1
/Delay 3
/Quickbar 1 0 2

Result: Triggers quickbar slot default bound to number-keys (not numpad-keys) 1 and 2 with delay (for cast-time) between```
**/Select** 

*You can select NPCName, CharacterName, ResourceName*

*Example 1:*
```/Select Adamantium
/Attack
/Delay 12
/Select Adamantium
/Attack
/Delay 12
/Select Adamantium
/Attack
/Delay 12

Put longer than necessary delay so macro won't get thrown off by the failbar. 
"12" is just an example - find out what works for you```

*Example 2:*
```This is more a proof of concept than a recommendation.
Clicking the skills have in my experience been a faster/safer option. 

/Select Kromede
/Skill Summon Holy Servant II
/Delay 1
/Skill Chastise I
Delay 1
/Select [TargetOfTarget]```
**/Fly**

*Useful as a macro connected to shortcut/keybinding. 
Fly and land can then be toggled on/off*

*Example*
```/Fly

Note: Yeah, it is what it is```
